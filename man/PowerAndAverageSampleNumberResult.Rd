\section{Fields}{

\describe{
\item{\code{nMax}}{The maximum sample size. Is a numeric vector of length 1 containing a whole number.}

\item{\code{theta}}{A vector of standardized effect sizes (theta values). Is a numeric vector.}

\item{\code{averageSampleNumber}}{The average sample number calculated for each value of \code{theta} or \code{nMax}, if the specified maximum sample size would be exceeded. Is a numeric vector.}

\item{\code{calculatedPower}}{The calculated power for the given scenario. Is a numeric vector of length 1 containing a value between 0 and 1.}

\item{\code{overallEarlyStop}}{The overall early stopping probability.}

\item{\code{earlyStop}}{The probability to stopping the trial either for efficacy or futility.}

\item{\code{overallReject}}{The overall rejection probability.}

\item{\code{rejectPerStage}}{The probability to reject a hypothesis per stage of the trial.}

\item{\code{overallFutility}}{The overall stopping for futility probability.}

\item{\code{futilityPerStage}}{The per-stage probabilities of stopping the trial for futility.}

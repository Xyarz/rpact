\title{Raw Dataset Of A Two Arm Continuous Outcome With Covariates}
\format{
A \code{\link[base]{data.frame}} object.
}
\usage{
rawDataTwoArmNormal
}
\description{
An artificial dataset that was randomly generated 
with simulated normal data. The data set has six variables:

1. Subject id
2. Stage number
3. Group name
4. An example outcome in that we are interested in
5. The first covariate *gender*
6. The second covariate *covariate*
}
\details{
See the vignette "Two-arm analysis for continuous data with covariates from raw data" 
to learn how to  

* import raw data from a csv file, 
* calculate estimated adjusted (marginal) means (EMMs, least-squares means) for a linear model, and 
* perform two-arm interim analyses with these data.

You can use \code{rawDataTwoArmNormal} to reproduce the examples in the vignette.
